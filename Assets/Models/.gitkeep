# Models Directory

This directory is for storing all 3D models used in the Music Room VR project.

## Contents:
- Drum kit components (drums, cymbals, stands)
- Room furniture and decorations
- Any additional instruments for future expansion

## Guidelines:
1. Use appropriate file formats (.fbx or .obj preferred)
2. Keep models optimized for VR performance
3. Organize complex models in subdirectories
4. Name files descriptively (e.g., "drum_snare_01.fbx", "cymbal_ride_01.fbx")
5. Include both high-poly (for reference) and low-poly (for game) versions if needed

## Structure Example:
/Models
  /DrumKit
    - bass_drum.fbx
    - snare.fbx
    - hihat.fbx
  /Environment
    - room_walls.fbx
    - floor.fbx
