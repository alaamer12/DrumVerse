# Audio Directory

This directory contains all audio assets for the Music Room VR project.

## Contents:
- Drum hit samples
- Ambient sounds
- Effect sounds
- Music tracks (if needed)

## Guidelines:
1. Use high-quality audio formats (.wav preferred for samples)
2. Organize drum sounds by type:
   - Kick drums
   - Snares
   - Cymbals
   - Toms
3. Include multiple velocity layers for realistic drum sounds
4. Keep files named consistently (e.g., "kick_vel1.wav", "snare_vel2.wav")
5. Optimize audio file length - trim silence

## Structure Example:
/Audio
  /DrumKit
    /Kick
      - kick_soft.wav
      - kick_medium.wav
      - kick_hard.wav
    /Snare
      - snare_soft.wav
      - snare_medium.wav
      - snare_hard.wav
  /Ambient
    - room_tone.wav
  /Effects
    - stick_hit.wav
